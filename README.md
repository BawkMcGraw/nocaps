# GroupMe No Shout Bot

DONT POST IN ALL CAPS. No body likes it. It's aggresive, annoying, and when someone actually needs your attention, you'll never know. But really, this bot doesn't fix any of that. It just insults you every time you type in all caps, whether its actually important or not.

## Structure

app.js
bot.js

app.js is responsible for all server handling.
bot.js is responsible for all logic handling.
pretty simple.

This is also the first bot I've written completely from scratch, so the network handling is bound to have issues. But hey, I DON'T NEED THE STARTER CODE ANYMORE. *confetti*
